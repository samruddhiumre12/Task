# AWS Lambda Function: Store a Document/PDF in an S3 Bucket

This is a simple AWS Lambda function that accepts a document (PDF or any file) as input and stores it in an S3 bucket.

## Function Overview

- The function takes a file (like a document or PDF) as an input in the `event` object.
- It uploads the file to a specified AWS S3 bucket.
- The S3 bucket's name and key (path) are determined by the input data.

## Input Format

The input to the Lambda function must be an object with the following properties:

- `bucketName`: The name of the S3 bucket where the file will be stored.
- `fileName`: The name of the file to be stored (including the file extension).
- `fileContent`: The content of the file to be uploaded. This should be base64 encoded.

Example input event:

```json
{
    "bucketName": "your-bucket-name",
    "fileName": "document.pdf",
    "fileContent": "base64encodedcontenthere=="
}
